Hello and welcome to my blog, where I will document my Deep Learning journey, with particular applications for computer vision tasks on Earth Observation (EO) data.

I have decided to start reading and going through the freely available course materials from Fast.ai [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/). This course uses the **fast.ai** framework and *Pytorch*.
